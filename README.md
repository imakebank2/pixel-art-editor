# Pixel art editor
This is a lightweight, minimalist, pixel art editor. 

My inspiration for this project was that I used to have trouble deciding what pixel art program to use when I started programming by making games (Aseprite is my tool of choice now). This program is designed to be extremely easy to use with minimal distractions.

I chose Rust because I used to have a terrible laptop and programs have only become heavier over time, so why not actually make something performant (even though optimising for performance *may* be overkill for this particular project). Rust seemed interesting and this project was a good excuse to learn it (and also it lets me flex that I use Rust). Having an excuse (i.e. motive/asking the *why*) to learn *anything* helps so much, especially for hobbies which can make your life much more enjoyable. This program may have been something I loved to have when starting my journey into programming and gamedev (well I haven't finished but I'm keeping old me in mind).
